# 👨‍💻 Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hey there! I'm Erin, a passionate backend developer with a keen interest in networking, cryptography, and retro computing. I'm on a journey to master various technologies, including AI, LLM, and more. I thrive on automating tasks and making processes more efficient. Oh, and did I mention how much I love working with SvelteKit?

## 🚀 About Me

- 👨‍💻 Backend Developer
- 🌐 Networking and Cryptography Enthusiast
- 🕹️ Retro Computing Fan (think IBM 360 series and C/Cobol/Fortran)
- 🎓 Proud Alumnus of 4 Educational Institutes (but I like learning by myself the most!)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 💻 Backend: Node.js, SvelteKit, Docker
- 🚀 Frontend: Svelte, Tailwind, DaisyUI
- 🧠 AI/ML: Microsoft Azure (custom vision, etc)
- 🧰 Tools: VSCode, WSL2, Obsidian

## 📚 Learning Journey

Now I've got some basic knowledge under my belt, I want to focus on a stripped down and efficient approach to web development as what sets me apart. I am disillusioned with modern bloat, and a classic approach that takes hardware optimisation and code efficiency into account is my goal. Let's make smooth software again that doesn't eat resources endlessly.
